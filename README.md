## Python Simple Authentication & Authorization API (PySAA)

This is a pet project I developed some years ago as first step in the selection process
for a developer position I applied to.

The package contains the following modules:

* dbapi -- manages database access logic
* model -- contains the classes that represent data model
* server -- implements the logic of PySAA
* settings -- contains configuration settings
* utils -- common utilities

*DISCLAIMER* At that time I had any knowledde about Python, I had to learn on the way while I was coding and
I had to finish the project in short time, therefore it might probably contain many errors. In coming weeks
I'll try to review the project, fix errors and write some tests to refresh my python skills.
